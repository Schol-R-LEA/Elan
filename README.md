# Elan
Elan is a test project for various approaches towards translating 
programming languages in the Lisp family. It is meant to use 
table-driven model that can be used for both interpreting and 
compiling, in which the 'target' - whether immediate by-expression
execution, translation to an intermediate interpretable form, or
compilation to an assembly language, or compilation to an executable
binary, can be encapsulated into a closure containing tables of
procedures and data needed to perform the translation.

This project is an intermediate experiment meant to further the development
of the language Apophasi, which is in turn a simplified testbed for
design ideas for a production-quality language called Thelema. 
Depnding on the outcome, the information gleaned from this may also
be applied to the associated Assiah assembler and other parts of
the toolchain which are intended to accompany Thelema in the future.
